#
# Branch Validation Workflow
#
# Validates feature branches and manages promotion to main through automated PRs.
# Uses the reusable branch validation workflow from the .github repository to
# maintain consistency across the organization.
#
# Features:
# - Always updates unstable tag (immediate testing availability)
# - Runs comprehensive validation (flake check, apps, content validation)
# - Creates/updates PRs automatically when validation passes
# - Creates/updates issues when validation fails (assigned to branch author)
# - Manages issue lifecycle (auto-close when tests pass)
#
# Triggered by: push to any branch except main
# Purpose: Automated validation and promotion pipeline for development branches
# Safety: All changes validated before reaching main branch
#
