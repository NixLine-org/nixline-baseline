# Validate Workflows (Baseline)
#
# Validates all workflow files in the baseline repository using the reusable
# workflow from the .github repository. Ensures YAML syntax, GitHub Actions
# syntax, and shell scripts are correct before workflows are used.
#
# Triggered by: push, pull_request when workflow files change
# Purpose: Quality control for baseline repository workflows
# Output: Prevents broken workflows from being deployed
