# SECURITY PACK
#
# This pack materializes a comprehensive SECURITY.md file following GitHub best practices.
# Based on industry standards from Microsoft, Node.js, and GitHub's recommendations.
#
# HOW TO CUSTOMIZE FOR YOUR ORG:
# 1. Update configuration in .nixline.toml or via config parameter
# 2. Adjust supportedVersions based on your release cadence
# 3. Modify response times to match your SLA
# 4. Add organization-specific security policies
#

    ## Bug Bounty Program

    ${securityConfig.orgName} operates a bug bounty program to encourage responsible security research.

    **Scope**: This program covers security vulnerabilities in our supported software versions.

    **Rewards**: Compensation is provided based on the severity and impact of discovered vulnerabilities.

    **Platform**: Reports should be submitted through our security contact email for coordination.

    ## Security Research Guidelines

    When investigating potential security issues, please:

    - **Act in good faith**: Avoid violating privacy, degrading services, or accessing unauthorized data
    - **Be patient**: Allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation before disclosure
    - **Be respectful**: Follow our code of conduct and communicate professionally
    - **Stay within scope**: Focus on security vulnerabilities, not general bugs or feature requests

    ### What We Consider Security Issues

    - Authentication bypasses
    - Authorization flaws
    - Data exposure vulnerabilities
    - Code injection (SQL, XSS, etc.)
    - Cryptographic weaknesses
    - Remote code execution
    - Denial of service vulnerabilities

    ### What We Don't Consider Security Issues

    - Missing security headers without demonstrated impact
    - Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
    - Issues in unsupported or end-of-life versions
    - Social engineering attacks
    - Physical security issues

      ${versionTable}

      ## Reporting a Vulnerability

      **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

      Instead, please report potential security vulnerabilities by emailing **${securityConfig.email}**.

      ### What to Include in Your Report

      To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

      - A clear description of the vulnerability

      - Potential impact assessment
      - Any suggested fixes or mitigations
      - Your contact information for follow-up

      ### What to Expect

      After submitting a report, you can expect:

      - **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **${securityConfig.acknowledgmentTime}**
      - **Initial Response**: We will provide an initial assessment within **${securityConfig.responseTime}**
      - **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
      - **Resolution**: We will notify you when the issue is resolved and publicly disclosed

      ## Responsible Disclosure

      We are committed to working with security researchers under responsible disclosure principles:

      1. **Investigation**: We will investigate all legitimate reports and work to fix valid issues
      2. **Communication**: We will maintain open communication throughout the process
      3. **Credit**: We will publicly credit researchers who discover vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
      4. **No Legal Action**: We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines
